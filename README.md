# SimulTimer

Simultimer is an app that makes timing multiple events easy. The goal of the app is to allow users to track time for one or multiple events, whether they be 
simulataneous (eg: cooking something in the oven while also cooking something on the stovetop) or chained together in a series of related events (eg: whitening 
your teeth with a kit that requires you to wear the whiteners for 20 minutes, then switch them out for different ones and wear those for an extra 30 minutes).
